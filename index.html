<H3 style="text-align:center">Bear Attacks</h3>

<P> Bear attacks happen fairly frequently, probably because they can look cuddly and many people associate bears with teddies, 
Yogi or Baloo, and do not give these powerful, deadly predators enough respect.
The people involved usually get more than just a hug.

Polar Bear- the largest land based carnivore. They can drag whales out of holes in the ice and stamp on seal lairs until they collapse. 
They are probably the most dangerous bear but there is not much dumb human food around.
The best place to see polar bears close-up is with the extremely experienced people of Churchill, Manitoba in Canada.

Brown or "Grizzly" Bear- not as big as its polar cousin but still big enough to kill a man with a single swipe of its paw.
However these bears tend to attack humans only if startled or with young.
If touched by a Grizzly, curl into a ball and play dead. If it continues to attack, fight back.

Black Bear are close, smaller relatives of the brown animals. These critters rarely attack humans, but will if they are starving.
Because they are relatively small, extreme aggression is the best tactic with this animal.
Playing "dead"" with black bears does NOT work.
<H3 style="text-align:center">Avoiding a Bear Encounter</H3>
<P> The one and only way to guarantee you will avoid a bear encounter is to stay out of areas where bears live. 
For many people that just isn't an option because they love hiking, biking, hunting, camping or just being in nature.
When Hiking, make your presence known while you are hiking. Don't be a stealth hiker. Hike in a group, the more the merrier. 
Making noise such as talking and singing gives an early warning to bears that they are not alone. 
When Camping, food is the most likely culprit for a bear entering you campsite. 
The National Parks Conservation Association suggests double-bagging and hanging your food a minimum of 14 
feet above the ground and at least 4 feet from the trunk of a tree.
Do not place your tent near hanging food or a car where food is stored. The smell may still attract the attention of a bear, and if it does,
you want the source of that food smell to be a fair distance from your tent. The suggested distance is 
100 yards.
